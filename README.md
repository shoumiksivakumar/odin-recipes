# Project #1: Operation 'odin-recipes'

The first project that we have to complete as part of the odin-project is a cookbook

Lessons learned so far:
* Navigating using git
* Creating a repository on github.com
* Connecting the repository to local machine
* FYI [git basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-git-basics) in case you forgot
